                    <p class="about-alumni">I joined when the team was only 3
                        months old, back in 2016. Honestly, there
                        was nothing apart from our laptop and a few
                        tables. I handled manufacturing and structural
                        simulation of composites and was involved in
                        working with different materials and manufacturing
                        methods. Working in thrustMIT was a fun-filled learning
                        experience with seniors who were very helpful in both
                        academics and team work. I still remember the
                        sleepless nights we spent perfecting Vyom. I was exci-
                        ted to do something outside my academics and meet
                        new people. During my tenure, I got the opportunity
                        to attend the Spaceport America Cup in 2018 and
                        2019.<br><br>
                        Today when I see what the teams is doing,
                        I feel proud of how they have
                        thrived and achieved so
                        much in the past years,</p>

                    <p class="about-alumni">Initially, I never thought I will be able
                        to make it through the 3-month taskphase,
                        then I focused on learning every day. There
                        were some hard times when I thought I can't
                        continue but dedication and hard work helped me
                        to sail through.<br> Within the team my job was
                        inter-departmental, I assisted all the subsystems. I was
                        involved in the design and development of pilot tubes,
                        ignition system, and research of various sensors and
                        electronic equipment.<br><br>
                        The team was very supportive and we had a deep
                        bond with each other, I didn't realize how 2 years
                        went by. In our time the whole team had put
                        their heart and soul to launch vyom and now
                        looking at the accomplishment
                        over the years, I am really
                        proud of the team,

                    <p class="about-alumni">I was really intrigued by thrustMiT as
                        they were bullding something that was
                        quite unique and challenging, especially at
                        undergraduate level. I joined when the project
                        was fairly new and fortunately got to directly interact
                        and work with the seniors who founded this project
                        and the team. Since rocketry was such an untraveled
                        topic back then, there were a lot of challenges and
                        failures that our team had to face before reaching
                        where we are today. Being a part of the team so
                        determined to succeed and constantly working
                        towards the goal helped me learn the most important
                        life values: perseverance & determination.<br><br>
                        It's been almost 2 years since I left thrustMIT but
                        to all the juniors who contributed to the
                        project so well thank you for
                        adding another ounce of
                        proud in all of us.
